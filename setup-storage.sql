-- Step 1: Create storage bucket for profile pictures
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('profile-pictures', 'profile-pictures', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Step 2: Drop existing storage policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own profile picture" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile picture" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view profile pictures" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile picture" ON storage.objects;

-- Step 3: Create storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own profile picture"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view profile pictures"
